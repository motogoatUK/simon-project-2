## User Experience (UX)

### Strategy
To create a memory game for casual gamers and other users to play and help improve memory skills. 
#### User goals:
The full user stories along with acceptance criteria and associated tasks can be found in the project board linked [here](https://github.com/users/motogoatUK/projects/5) and above. Below is a short summary of these goals:
 - Visitor requires responsive layout
 - Player wants a clean game interface
 - Gamer wants to play the game
 - Player wants to see high score
 - Player would like to see varying images
 - Gamer wants to personalise the game experience
 - Gamer would like to see animations and/or sound

### Scope
**Must-have** *Required features for production release:*
- Responsive layout
- Game interface
- Game actions
- High Score  

**Should-have** *Features for next release:*
- Varying images
- Personalised Experience  

**Could-have** *Features for future releases:*  
- Animations & Sound  


### Structure
All features on a single HTML page using modal windows for additional information (e.g. scores/instuctions)  
404 error page to direct back to main page.  
As this is just a single page website I decided not to use bootstrap and instead use flex and CSS media queries for layout.
